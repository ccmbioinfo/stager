name: Build, lint, and deploy frontend
# Runs package scripts on pull requests and commits to master affecting the frontend
# or this workflow itself. Dependencies are cached in Actions to reduce runtime.
# Frontend tests may optionally be added.
#
# Commits to master can access secrets stored in GitHub Environments on this repository
# to deploy into a MinIO bucket. This is a self-hosted solution equivalent to static sites
# hosted out of Amazon S3. For this deploy job to start, a reviewer must further approve
# the deployment for the workflow run under the Actions tab.
#
# Environments can be managed in the Settings tab (https://github.com/ccmbioinfo/stager/settings/environments)
# To add a new environment or rotate secrets for an existing one:
# - create a bucket to host the built static files
# - set an anonymous read access policy on the bucket
# - create an IAM policy that can read and write to the bucket
# - create a machine user with a securely-generated password and apply the above policy
# - set environment secret DEPLOY_MINIO_BUCKET to the name of the designated bucket
# - set environment secret DEPLOY_MC_HOST to https://MACHINE_USER_ACCESS_KEY:GENERATED_SECRET_KEY@minio.domain
#
# The REACT_APP_EMAIL and REACT_APP_MINIO_URL may or may not vary by environment,
# but they are just build parameters.
#
# REACT_APP_LABS_JSON will be written out to public/labs.json only if it exists,
# for multitenant deployments. Apostrophes must be escaped in this secret.
